Notejam (https://github.com/komarserjio/notejam) is a web application written in many different languages and
frameworks for the sake of exercising new ways of writing code: 


●  Deploy that on a cloud service that best suits the workload 
●  Automate the delivery 
●  Document your work, including a slide presentation of your solution and the key decision points when you made them 
●  Provide complete source code for the automation solution you developed and the forked application


These are nice to have, extra tasks: 
●  Ensure that the application uses a cloud database service 
●  Provide highly-available deployments (blue-green or canary, for example) 
●  Ensure application and your work are tested properly (and actions are taken when test fails) 
●  Ensure that logs are collected for application and your work 
●  Ensure that metrics are collected for application and your work 
●  Ensure that any used storage is properly backed-up
